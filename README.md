=========

*Bloom* is an optimized implementation of a bloom effect.

*Bloom* has some special features:

- Two different types of blur filters: *fringe* (small gaussian filter) and
  *diffusion* (large box filter).
- Temporal low-pass filtering: rejects intensely oscillating pixels to
  eliminate unpleasant flicker.

System Requirements
-------------------

*Bloom* is optimized for HDR and linear rendering. Although it can run without
these features, it's strongly recommended to enable them for optimal quality.

Because of this requirement, it's not recommended to use on mobile platforms
that lack linear rendering.
